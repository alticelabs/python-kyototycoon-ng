ABOUT
-----
Python client library for Kyoto Tycoon. For more information on
Kyoto Tycoon please refer to the official project website:

  http://fallabs.com/kyototycoon/

This library's interface follows the preferred interface
provided by Kyoto Tycoon's original author(s):

  http://fallabs.com/kyototycoon/kyototycoon.idl

There is currently no documentation for this software but in
the meantime please see the file "kyototycoon.py" for the
interface.

This fork is backwards compatible, and includes cursor support
and significant performance improvements over the original
library. It also supports both Python 2.x and 3.x.

The more efficient binary protocol is also supported along with
the HTTP protocol. It provides a performance improvement of up
to 6x, but only the following operations are available:

  * ``get()`` and ``get_bulk()``
  * ``set()`` and ``set_bulk()``
  * ``remove()`` and ``remove_bulk()``

Other operations will throw a ``NotImplementedError`` exception.


INSTALLATION
------------
Using pip::

    pip install python-kyototycoon

Or, from source::

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

Binary protocol support was added by Carlos Rodrigues based
on Ulrich Mierendorff's code with only minimal changes to make
it fit this library. You can find the original library at the
