ABOUT
-----
Python client library for Kyoto Tycoon. For more information on
Kyoto Tycoon please refer to the official project website.

  http://fallabs.com/kyototycoon/

python-kyototycoon's interface follows the preferred interface
provided by Kyoto Tycoon's original author(s).

  http://fallabs.com/kyototycoon/kyototycoon.idl

There is currently no documentation for this software but for
the meantime please see kyototycoon.py for the interface.

This fork is backwards compatible, and includes cursor support
and significant performance improvements over the original
library.

The binary protocol is also supported along the HTTP protocol,
for a performance improvement of around 6x. Only a minimal
subset of operations are supported for this protocol, namely:

    - get() and get_bulk()
    - set() and set_bulk()
    - remove() and remove_bulk()

These methods are based on Ulrich Mierendorff's code with only
minimal changes to make it fit this library. You can find the
original library supporting the binary protocol at his website.

INSTALLATION
------------
Using pip::

    pip install python-kyototycoon

Or, from source::

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install


KNOWN ISSUES
------------
    * When using the HTTP protocol and KT_PACKER_STRING, if
      values are unicode strings "set()" is about 20x slower
      compared to non-unicode strings.
    * With Python 2.6, all HTTP operations are about 20x
      slower than Python 2.7. There is no such difference
      when using the binary protocol.
